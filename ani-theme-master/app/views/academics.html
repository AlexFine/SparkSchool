            <p class="lead"><b>What is Spark Charter?</b> Spark Charter School aims to complement the efforts of the Sunnyvale School District by offering an educational model that provides its students with the most effective ways to realize their potential.  The school’s educational vision is rooted in constructivist learning theory, informed by neuroscience research, and exemplified by the respect and compassion for each child’s unique strengths. Instruction at Spark is based on a dynamic inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. By integrating social emotional growth, physical movement, and the creative arts into a rigorous academic program, Spark raises the intellectual and social capital of each child and the diverse community it aims to serve. </p>
           <p class="lead"><b>Spark Charter's Mission</b> is to flourish in the 21st century, students must not only learn, but they must learn how to learn. They must develop a capacity for creativity, critical thinking, skillful problem solving, and effective communication.  They must be culturally and globally aware, technically literate, and learn to develop a sense of personal and collective responsibility. SPARK Charter School, a K-8 public charter school, seeks to lead students on a collaborative, parent-assisted, hands-on learning adventure that will develop the skills and habits of mind necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
