        Constructivism as a learning theory has been developing for more than a century. Scientific research indicates that learning is an active process within the brain and that the brain literally constructs understanding by building and refining connections among neurons[i]. Research shows that student engagement in interactive lessons that focus on learning for meaning leads to greater retention and use of information and ideas[ii]. Students engaged in this type of learning gain greater conceptual understanding that is retained and transferred to other meaningful applications. Rote memorization, on the other hand, is easily forgotten. A recent analysis of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMSS) data from seven countries indicates that the high-achieving countries devote more instruction to exploring concepts and making connections to solve problems than memorizing procedures.[iii]
    </p>
        <p class="lead"><b>The Helical Model</b> The Helical Model™, invented by experienced educator and Spark Curriculum Architect Gigi Carunungan, is composed of  five stages of learning: Play, Explore, Connect, Imagine, and Remember.  A lesson begins with a simple and fun activity to build interest and introduce the topic, then provides students with hands-on activities and interactive projects that engage them in expanding and applying the subject matter. The process moves from simple to increasingly complex and imaginative concepts and tasks. After learning the core concepts and practices, students design and build an innovative project that addresses a community and/or world problem. At the end of every module, students review the lessons and collectively highlight key points, formulate questions, and deduce meanings from their experiences and discoveries. Guided by the teacher, students build theories about the topic, using the concepts and processes they have experienced.

        Collective Class Learning Experience
    </b>
        The Helical Model is a learning process guiding the curriculum along the Constructivist framework. Students analyze patterns, failures and successes, concepts, and possibilities in a logical and increasingly complex and challenging flow of activities.  The Helical Model also makes possible a multi-modality curricular design that addresses different learning styles. Inspired by Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, the multi-sensory and integrated arts activities allow learners of all styles to actively participate in subject matter exploration, application, and mastery through a progression of learning activities. Students engage in a combination of kinesthetic, visual and verbal lesson strategies.  Involvement in guided activities becomes the collective class experience from which students learn to deduce their own theories and concepts in science, social studies, language arts, and mathematics. By the time the teacher presents, for example, a scientific law, a social or economic concept, a mathematical algorithm, or a literary style, students will have the experience, knowledge, and skills to engage in critical conversations about it.

            Distilling from Practice and Forming Theories
        </b>
            The Helical Model equips students with a process to understand, analyze, and probe more complex and substantive aspects of a topic. An important aspect of the learning process is the documenting of observations, formulating conclusions, and analyzing these vis-a-vis alternate theories. Through inquiry and analysis, the teacher guides students in analyzing observations of an experiment, experience, readings, and/or other research data. Information provided by students is organized into categories. Through a collective process of reflection, students are prepared to read and research, connect, and engage in challenging discourse. Higher order thinking is facilitated when the class is able to expand learning by comparing their experiences and conclusions to the writings of scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, authors, and/or historians.        </p>
