			<h1><u>Academic Vision</u></h1>
			<p class="lean" style="margin:10px;">At Spark Charter School, we seek to educate the whole child.  Education of character helps children develop a sense of moral integrity and respect for the individual, the community, and democratic ideals. Education of the intellect concerns itself with understanding the learning process, developing intellectual skills, and acquiring knowledge.  It is within this context, that we can ensure each child will receive an academically rigorous learning experience within a supportive environment that values social and emotional learning in equal parts to academic achievement.  </p>

            <p class="lead">At Spark Charter School, we seek to educate the whole child.  Education of character helps children develop a sense of moral integrity and respect for the individual, the community, and democratic ideals. Education of the intellect concerns itself with understanding the learning process, developing intellectual skills, and acquiring knowledge. </p>
					<h4><i>EDUCATION OF CHARACTER</i></h4>
           <p class="lead"><b><i>Valuing Moral Courage.</i> </b> We believe that values are expressed more by what we do, what we say, and what we believe rather than by the blind following of rules and regulations. Context matters when children make decisions.  Our goal is to support kids to understand and value their own feelings and to empathize with others.  Educators respect the questions and concerns of students. In turn, we expect students to respect the advice and counsel of their teachers and their peers.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Valuing Each Individual.</i> </b>We want students to recognize and respect the different forms of intelligence and to identify and develop their own unique abilities. Students are encouraged to contribute by sharing their talents. </p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Valuing School and Community.</i> </b>We work to instill in our students a sense of responsibility for themselves, as well as for the school community, and the larger world. There are many opportunities during the school day for cooperative work, by which students help each other meet goals and complete tasks. Students are encouraged not only to enjoy the benefits of the school, the community and the larger world.  However, with these benefits comes a degree of responsibility.  </p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Valuing Democratic Ideals.</i> </b> Spark Charter School is committed to achieving a diverse student body that reflects the surrounding community of Sunnyvale and Silicon Valley.  Students to be open-minded and fair.  Within our curriculum, we communicate stories and experiences of the different ethnic groups in our society, thereby fostering appreciation of diverse racial, cultural, and historical backgrounds.</p>
					<h4><i>EDUCATION OF THE INTELLECT</i></h4>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Understanding the Learning Process.</i> </b>Students are encouraged to understand concepts by studying ideas. We challenge them to ask hard questions, to make connections, to reason, to test ideas, to predict, to analyze, and to generalize. We want our students to respect the learning process –not just the result of that process.  Learning is messy.  Learning is fun.  And, learning can be frustrating.  We encourage students to give themselves permission to be confused, to appreciate mistakes, and to understand that exploration, grit, and experimentation - rather than simple and immediate solutions - lead to deepest knowledge. We try to teach that uncertainty is not ignorance and that clarity of thought often comes only at the end of a long process. In their search for understanding, we help students to value imagination and creativity. </p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Developing Intellectual Skills.</i> </b> At Spark, skills are not mastered just as ends but rather as tools. We learn to read in order to answer questions or for pleasure; we write, we paint, and we compose music to explore an idea or express understanding; we speak to explain feelings or ideas; we compute to solve problems.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Acquiring Knowledge.</i> </b>Acquisition of knowledge occurs in developmentally appropriate steps. Our curriculum pulls content from mathematics, science, history, geography, social sciences, language, literature, art, music, drama, dance, physical education, and technology; our teachers structure learning experiences to fit a variety of developmental stages, interests, and learning styles. We strive to understand the social, emotional, and physical realities of students' lives in order to integrate learning experiences here at school with the broader issues facing students in the larger world. </p>
					<h4><i>HOW WE GET THERE</i></h4>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Active Learning.</i> </b> We accomplish our goals of educating the character and intellect through active learning. We believe in guided exploration and discovery, leading to mastery. Students at Spark will develop self awareness around how they learn with the goal of becoming flexible thinkers and independent learners by helping formulate the questions that guide their learning. Educators help students develop strategies to plan and manage their time, to make choices, and to solve problems. Built into the curriculum are many opportunities for asking questions, researching answers, and experiencing the consequences of choice.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Community of Learners. </i> </b>Educators should model enthusiastic learning. Powerful educators value learning and communicate excitement. Our curriculum constantly evolves and responds to the needs and interests of students and educators.  This is why it is to be expected to see students and teachers learning side by side.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Thematic Learning.</i> </b>We use a thematic context to create a need to inquire, to do purposeful research, to communicate, and to solve problems. Academic skills are taught in a meaningful, integrated way. Connections made among skills, knowledge, and concepts across the disciplines deepen student understanding. A thematic approach to learning offers possibilities for understanding material through traditional academic disciplines, as well as through alternative pathways - singing, dancing, painting, building, acting, and composing. A thematic curriculum thereby accommodates a variety of learning styles.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Flexible Groupings and Individualization.</i> </b>We respond to the needs of our students through flexible groupings. Different kinds of grouping ensure optimal learning situations. Grouping children of varying ages and abilities enhances the opportunity for each child to work, learn, play, and explore at his or her individual level, regardless of age. A child in a vertically grouped classroom, for example, has an opportunity to be among the youngest in a group and to experience the uniqueness of that role. Later the same child will be among the oldest in the group and will learn the expectations and responsibilities associated with that position. Vertical grouping provides many occasions for leadership skills to be developed. Homogeneous groupings by grade or by learning style provide opportunities to consolidate skills or focus on social or academic concerns.<br> Teachers often will work with the same children over a number of years, eliminating the usual getting-to-know-you lag and the time it often takes a student to learn classroom routines. More importantly, strong personal and working relationships between student and teacher can be forged over the course of two or three years. This permits maximum attention to each student, educationally and emotionally.</p>
					<p class="lead"><b><i>Kindergarten – Grade 8 Community.</i> </b> We can create and nurture a caring and loving environment optimally with a relatively small school community. Close-knit bonds develop among students, educators, parents, and administrators. The school provides leadership opportunities for adolescents, as well as an intimate environment for our youngest learners. </p>

<p class="lead" style="margin:20px; text-align:center;"> Many people consider Coding to be the new literacy—a form of digital literacy that some think transcends the ancient paper and words concept of literacy.  In 2015, there was a significant push for more coding classes, “Coding Boot camps,” and other kinds of coding activities that have given the idea new urgency.  Though there are many persuasive reasons why coding should not be taught in school, the reasons in favor of coding in schools cannot be dismissed.  Why should all students be exposed and learn to code?  </p>
