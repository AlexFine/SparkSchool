Refer to enrollment dates on the Spark Charter School website enrollment calendar. Placements will be determined beginning with Kindergarten, and continue up through grade 8. Successful applicants will be notified by email or telephone within three business days that they are being offered a placement at Spark Charter School. Following this notification, families must respond within three business days. An observation will be set up at that time to occur within seven regular school days (excludes field trips, test days and special programs.). After the observation has been completed families need to deliver, in writing, their acceptance of the placement within two business days. If acceptance is not received in writing by the deadline, the placement will be offered to another applicant. Registration of the learner should be completed within five business days following acceptance of a placement.</p> <br> <br> <p class=lean>Those families who file an application, but for whom we do not have space, are placed on a wait list, which is managed by the Executive Director. The wait list is divided into two sections: applicants from Sunnyvale School District and applicants from outside the Sunnyvale School District. If an opening is created that school year, those families will have the opportunity to enroll at Spark Charter School based on their position on the wait list. If a family is offered a space before the beginning of the school year but declines, they will be taken off the wait list and will have to reapply should they wish to attend Spark Charter School in the future. If a family is offered a placement during summer vacation (defined as the last day of school in June to the first day of school in August) they need to deliver their acceptance in writing within five business days without benefit of additional observations or tours. If a family is offered a space after the beginning of the school year but declines, they may choose to go to the bottom of their respective section of the wait list. A family can decline an offer after the beginning of the school year only one time. If a space becomes available for the same child after the start of a different school year and the family declines, they will be taken off the wait list.</p> <br><br> <p class=lean> Residents of the Sunnyvale School District are defined as persons who reside in the District as of May 1 of the preceding school year. A learner entering Spark Charter School from the in-district wait list is required to reside solely in the Sunnyvale School District. When applications are received after the enrollment deadline for the upcoming school year they will be placed on the wait lists according to the following criteria:</p><br><br> <p class=lean>Families who, BEFORE June 30 of the upcoming school year, move to the Sunnyvale School District, or who can show proof that they will be living in the Sunnyvale School District before the beginning of the new school year (on or near the beginning of September), will be placed on the bottom of the Spark Charter School in-district wait list.</p><br><br> <p class=lean>Families who cannot show this proof will be placed at the bottom of the non-Sunnyvale School District wait list. After they move to the Sunnyvale School District they can be moved to the Sunnyvale in-district wait list for the following year. That is, a family must be able to prove residency or pending residency in the Sunnyvale School District prior to June 30 of the upcoming school year to be placed on the Spark Charter School in-district wait list.</p><br><br> <p class=lean><i>It is the responsibility of Spark Charter School to verify residency and ensure compliance with all enrollment policies. Any applicant found to be willfully in violation of residency requirements will have their application removed from all wait lists and will need to reapply during the next enrollment cycle.</i></p> </div> <br> </div><hr> <img src=../images/2F2A0718.jpg style="width:70%; margin:10px; border-radius:5px;"> <div class=container2 id=learn> <div class="row eight" style="margin:0 auto;"> <h1><u>Enrollment Policy </u></h1> <p class=lean>Spark Charter School is a public school with limited enrollment.
