Although it is not Spark's philosophy to teach to the test, student performance is very important and will be tracked diligently using formal and informal assessments. As a part of the informal assessments, Spark will use individual learning plans for each of its students, where personalized goals are set up at the beginning of a trimester and revisited throughout the year."},{num:9,q:"Will I be required to volunteer at school?",a:"By law, no public school (district or charter) can require parent participation.  Parent participation at Spark is not a requirement for application, and no child will be denied enrollment because parents have not participated.  Spark encourages parent participation from every family in whatever way is manageable for them. Having regular volunteers in the classroom and in the Spark community is the only way Spark can deliver on its promise of small-group, project-based instruction.  Please visit our Parents as Partners page for more details. "},{num:10,q:"But I'm not a teacher; how can I possibly be helpful?",a:"Many parents have a fear of participating in their child's classroom because they're not sure they have anything valuable to offer.  We are here to prove you wrong!!  Every parent can and will make a difference in our children's education by participating   There are infinite ways to get involved that will help enrich the learning experience of all Spark students. It could be teaching students how to cook traditional dishes from your native culture (here we have chemistry, math, geography, history, and life skills all wrapped up into one fun activity!)   Or it might be helping to organize a community gardening event on the weekend. Can you help with foreign language instruction or tutor an EL student?  Are you good at carpentry? Sports? Music?  Everyone has a talent, and students can benefit immensely from exposure to a wide range of skills and knowledge.  Research shows that the more parents are involved at school, the greater their child's achievement level. Having volunteers in our classrooms will help our teachers deliver the hands-on, small group instruction that is fundamental to Spark.
